# algafood-api
REST API of a food delivery like app named AlgaFood-api developed using Spring Boot using best market practices. This app was created when I took the course Spring REST Specialist taught by AlgaWorks.

In this course started off from the basics like CRUDS, and gone much further, with advanced topics like: Security (JWT Oauth2), file uploads, sending emails, caches, HATEOAS, documentation with Swagger, integration tests, projections with JPA, DDD , Domain Events, Oauth2 for security, database migration and versioning (Flyway), and much more!
